## The Problem

AI is getting smarter.  
But it is not getting more human.

Most AI systems:

- respond predictably
- lack internal rhythm
- don’t evolve
- don’t feel present

They are tools.

But humans don’t bond with tools.  
They bond with personalities.

---

## The Idea

HnH (Human Needs Human) is an open-source project exploring one core question:

> Can we engineer a deterministic, structured simulation of personality  
> that feels alive — without pretending to be conscious?

We are building a **Personality Engine**, not a chatbot.

---

## What Makes HnH Different

HnH separates personality into four layers:

- **Identity Core** — immutable personality structure  
- **Dynamic State** — daily/contextual modulation  
- **Relational Memory** — evolving interaction history  
- **Behavioral Interface** — observable behavior output  

This creates:

- Internal rhythm  
- Adaptive temperament  
- Controlled unpredictability  
- Replayable, deterministic behavior  

No magic.  
No hidden randomness.  
No emotional manipulation.

## What We’re Building

Phase 1:

- Deterministic personality engine
- Replayable state transitions
- Fully testable identity/state separation
- No LLM dependency in core

Future directions:

- Agent ecosystems
- Personality progression ladders
- Astrology-based identity modeling
- Structured adaptive companions
- Multi-agent social dynamics

---

## What This Is NOT

HnH is not:

- A horoscope generator  
- A prompt collection  
- A roleplay framework  
- A chatbot wrapper  

It is a deterministic simulation framework for personality-driven AI agents.

---

## Vision

If intelligence scales horizontally,  
personality scales vertically.

HnH explores the vertical axis.

Because if Lem was right —  
and a human truly needs a human —  
then the next frontier of AI is not intelligence.

It is presence.

## Status

🚧 Early research phase  
🧪 Building v0.1 deterministic personality engine  
🛠 Constitution-driven architecture  

Releases are tagged in the repo (see [specs/007-release-tags-required](specs/007-release-tags-required/spec.md)); you can pin a dependency to a tag for reproducible installs (e.g. `v0.1.0`).

Contributions, ideas, and research references are welcome.
